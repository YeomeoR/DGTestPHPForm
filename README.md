# DGTestPHPForm

Test form in PHP for Digital Grads recruitment

This form was created using VS Code and 'vanilla' PHP, HTML5, CSS3 & JS (without libraries).

To run this app, clone this repository and start server on localhost:8000/home_page.php

Basic validation limited to email, using PHP. 

HTML validates inputs automatically unless 'switched off'. In which case, PHP email validation takes over as per the code.

Select a file to upload from device/computer. This sent with the email when form is submitted but will be sent (in this instance) 
to the 'assets/images/' folder of the cloned project, in the text editor.

The information from the input fields on the form will be sent to an email address (in this instance: email@yeomeo.dev)

The layout is responsive, in that when on a mobile device, it narrows to a single column.

Styling is basic but with slightly more character than the test sample.

Project is also served and is live, on my portfolio website at https://yeomeo.dev/home_page.php
