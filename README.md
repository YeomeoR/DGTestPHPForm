# DGTestPHPForm

Test form in PHP for Digital Grads recruitment

This form was created using VS Code and 'vanilla' PHP, HTML5, CSS3 & JS (without libraries).

To run this app, clone this repository and start server on localhost:8000/home_page.php

Basic validation limited to email, using PHP. 

HTML validates inputs automatically unless 'switched off'. In which case, PHP email validation takes over as per the code.

Select a file to upload from device/computer. This sent with the email when form is submitted but will be sent (in this instance) 
to the 'assets/images/' folder of the cloned project, in the text editor, not the email recipient. On screen display showing the 
details of the upload and sent file in the form of an array in plain text using a simple function and 'print_r' between 'pre' tags, 
test_form.php, lines 70-74 (just for information).

The information from the input fields on the form will be sent to an email address (in this instance: email@yeomeo.dev)

The layout is responsive, in that when on a mobile device, it narrows to a single column.

Styling is basic but with slightly more character than the test sample.
