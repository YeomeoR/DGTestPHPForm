# DGTestPHPForm

Test form in PHP for Digital Grads recruitment

This form was created using VS Code and 'vanilla' PHP, HTML5, CSS3 & JS (without libraries).

To run this app, clone this repository and start server on localhost:8000/home_page.php

Basic validation limited to email, using PHP. 

HTML validates inputs automatically unless 'switched off'. In this case, PHP email validation takes over.
